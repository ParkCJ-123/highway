 To live is to suffer, <strong>to <u>survive</u></strong> is to find some meaning in the suffering. - Friedrich Nietzsche<br><br>

<br><br>Journeys are the midwives of thought. Few places are more conducive to internal conversations than a moving plane, ship or train. There is an almost quaint correlation between what is in front of our eyes and the thoughts we are able to have in our heads: large thoughts at times requiring large views, new thoughts new places. Introspective reflections which are liable to stall are helped along by the flow of the landscape. <strong>The mind may be <u>reluctant</u> to think properly when thinking is all it is</strong> supposed to do.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">At the end of hours of train-dreaming, we may feel we have been returned to ourselves - that is, brought back into contact with emotions and ideas of importance to us. It is not necessarily at home that we best encounter our true selves. The furniture insists that we cannot change because it does not; the domestice setting keeps us tethered to the person we are in ordinary life, but who may not be who we essentially are.</p>
